    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Kholodets or Meat Aspic is a traditional Ukrainian dish that is served with spicy horseradish and beet sauce. The kholodets itself is made with tender chunks of meat suspended in flavorful gelatinized broth. Not only is it delicious, but it’s also good for you!</p>
    <p>Both terms refer to a meat dish that is made of meat that’s surrounded by flavorful gelatinized stock. Molded aspics used to be very popular in the 1950s but have now long been forgotten about. Not in Eastern Europe though. Many Eastern European countries like Russia and Ukraine still serve this popular dish, especially around major holidays.</p>
    <p>While the idea may sound strange, I call on you to be adventurous and try it at least once. So, what does it taste like? Aspic is served cold, but once it hits your mouth you’re left with tender meat chunks that are now surrounded by a flavorful bone broth that melts from the heat of your mouth. Combine it with some spicy beet horseradish relish and good crusty bread and you’ve got a true Ukrainian treat!</p>
    <p>Aside from the flavor benefits of this dish, did you know that Kholodets is amazing for your bone and joint health? The collagen, glutamine, and glycine which are extracted out of the bones and released during cooking are really good for the immune system and gut health. You can probably google “bone broth” to learn more about this.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul class="ingr-list">
        <li>2 pigs feet</li>
        <li>1 pig’s rear hock</li>
        <li>2 lbs beef boneless beef chuck</li>
        <li>2 lbs pork loin </li>
        <li>2 large onions</li>
        <li>2 large carrots</li>
        <li>2 stalks celery</li>
        <li>15 black peppercorns</li>
        <li>2 bay leaves</li>
        <li>1.5 tablespoons pf kosher salt</li>
        <li>2 qts cold water</li>
        <li>1 bunch parsley</li>
        <li>6-8 cloves garlic</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol class="steps-list">
        <li>1st boil: To a large 8 qt pot add 2 pigs feet, 1 rear hock, 2 lbs pork loin, 2 lbs of boneless beef chuck, and add enough water to cover the meat. Bring to a boil and let cook for 5 minutes. Next, remove the meat to a clean bowl. Discard the cooking liquid and wash the pot clean.</li>
        <li>2nd boil: Add all the meat back to the pot, cover with fresh water and bring to a boil. Then, reduce the heat to a gentle simmer and cook for about 5 hours. All throughout cooking constantly skim the top from impurities with a slotted spoon. Do not cover with a lid.</li>
        <li>Keep an eye on the water level and add more if needed to keep the meat submerged at all times. If needed add a smaller sized lid or dinner plate to the top of the meat to weigh the meat down and under the water.</li>
        <li>Add aromatics: Now add 2 onions, 2 carrots, 3 stalks celery, 15 black peppercorns, 2 bay leaves, and 1 Tbsp of salt to the stock. Continue simmering for 1 more hour.</li>
        <li>Remove solids: Remove all meat chunks from the broth to a large bowl and leave to cool to room temp.<br>Remove and discard the remaining vegetables (onions, carrots, and bay leaves).</li>
        <li>Lastly, add 6-8 cloves of minced garlic and 1 bunch of parsley to the broth and simmer for 2 minutes. Taste the broth and adjust the salt amount without disturbing the broth too much as not to break any remaining impurities.</li>
        <li>Once the meat has cooled, discard the pig's feet, any bones, fat, or skin.<br>Shred the meat into bite-sized pieces and add to a 9"x12" baking dish in an even layer.<br>To make the meat aspic in individual portions, portion the meat between deep soup bowls or other small, but deep containers.<br>Cover & refrigerate until ready for next step.</li>
        <li>While the meat is cooling drain and cool the broth: set a sieve lined with 2-3 layers of paper towels over a large pot. Carefully drain the broth to remove any solids, fat, or impurities. Change the paper towels as the broth stops flowing through – the fat creates a barrier and prevents the liquid from going through.<br>To get an absolutely fat-free broth, you might need to drain the broth through paper towels several times. Any fat left in the broth will cover the aspic in white patches as it solidifies if not removed at this stage. For best results, cool the broth to room temperature before using it in the next steps. Otherwise pouring hot broth over the meat will melt the fat in the meat and make it float to the top.</li>
        <li>Add half the broth to the meat: pour half of the cooled to room temperature broth over the meat. Skim any fat that floats to the top with a spoon. Refrigerate for about 45 minutes to slightly set. This will prevent the meat from floating to the top as you pour the other half of the broth. Keep the other half of the broth mixture at room temperature as the first half sets in the fridge.</li>
        <li>Add the remainder of the broth: Once lightly set, remove the kholodets from the fridge and pour the remaining half of the broth over the top covering the meat completely. Add leaves of parsley for garnish if desired. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until completely set, about 4-5 hours or overnight.</li>
        <li>Once set, cut into 2×2 squares and serve alongside some beet & horseradish relish.</li>

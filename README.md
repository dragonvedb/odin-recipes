Creating this page is part of The Odin Project curriculum. It is meant to test my ability to create a multi-page HTML-only website, and host in on GitHub. It is my first actual GitHub submission.

Even though I am already an expert-tier HTML supraengineer, it will probably take me a while to adjust to working in a real dev-environment instead of a freeCodeCamp web-editor. Pushin' commits and what not....

Still, I expect things to go smoothly. I hope by the end of it I will "get" the Git workflow.

The project seems to be succesfully completed. Working with Git is less of a hassle then I initially expected, though it still bothers me that I can't just change something minor without writing a whole commit about it. But I'll get used to it.

It was a fun exercise. Hail Odin

Returning to this project, because it turns out now I have to CSS style it to my heart's content. This is usually quite a hiccup for me, since I have no idea how a good site is supposed to look. Especially a good site that is quick to build, since I don't want to get bogged down for days here. I suppose I shouldn't stress too much over it; it's not like I'm showing it to anybody...


couple hours later...

I guess it's done. Very barebones design, but I think the color palette's got some charm. Could also add a "back to the top" button, but nah. All that's left is hosting the site on GitHub.

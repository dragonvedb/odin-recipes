15 of September 2022:

Creating this page is part of The Odin Project curriculum. It is meant to test my ability to create a multi-page HTML-only website, and host in on GitHub. It is my first actual GitHub submission.

Even though I am already an expert-tier HTML supraengineer, it will probably take me a while to adjust to working in a real dev-environment instead of a freeCodeCamp web-editor. Pushin' commits and what not....

Still, I expect things to go smoothly. I hope by the end of it I will "get" the Git workflow.

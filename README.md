Creating this page is part of The Odin Project curriculum. It is meant to test my ability to create a multi-page HTML-only website, and host in on GitHub. It is my first actual GitHub submission.

Even though I am already an expert-tier HTML supraengineer, it will probably take me a while to adjust to working in a real dev-environment instead of a freeCodeCamp web-editor. Pushin' commits and what not....

Still, I expect things to go smoothly. I hope by the end of it I will "get" the Git workflow.

The project seems to be succesfully completed. Working with Git is less of a hassle then I initially expected, though it still bothers me that I can't just change something minor without writing a whole commit about it. But I'll get used to it.

It was a fun exercise. Hail Odin
